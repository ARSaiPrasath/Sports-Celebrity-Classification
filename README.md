# Sports-Celebrity-Classification
Created an end to end application for classifying Sports celebrities. 
Created a Machine Learning model using Support Vector Machine for classification. 
And I created a Flask Server for hosting the model and created Front End UI using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people,
1. Maria Sharapova
2. Serena Williams
3. Virat Kohli
4. Roger Federer
5. Lionel Messi

Technologies used in this project,
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
