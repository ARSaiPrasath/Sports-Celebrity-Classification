# Sports-Celebrity-Classification
Created an end to end application for classifying Sports celebrities. 
Used HaarCascades Algorithm and PyWavelets for getting the features(face and eyes) and converting the face into a wavelet form.
Created a Machine Learning model using Support Vector Machine for classification. 
I have restricted the classification to only 5 people, Lionel Messi, Maria Sharapova, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, and Virat Kohli. 
And I created a Flask Server for deploying the model and created UI using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In this data science and machine learning project, we classify sports personalities. We restrict classification to only 5 people,
1. Maria Sharapova
2. Serena Williams
3. Virat Kohli
4. Roger Federer
5. Lionel Messi

Technologies used in this project,
1. Python
2. Numpy and OpenCV for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
